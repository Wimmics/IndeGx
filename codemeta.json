    "description": "IndeGx is a framework created for the creation of an RDF knowledge graph that can be used as an index of knowledge graphs available online. It uses a set of rules to extract and compute the content of this index using SPARQL queries.\n\nIndeGx is designed to make full use of semantic web standards. Any rules expressed with a standard SPARQL syntax can be used to generate a knowledge graph.",
