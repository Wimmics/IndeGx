Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. This is often described as a mission capable rate. Mathematically, this is expressed as 100% minus unavailability. * The ratio of (a) the total time a functional unit is capable of being used during a given interval to (b) the length of the interval. For example, a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week (168 hours) would have an availability of 100/168. However, typical availability values are specified in decimal (such as 0.9998). In high availability applications, a metric known as nines, corresponding to the number of nines following the decimal point, is used. With this convention, \"five nines\" equals 0.99999 (or 99.999%) availability. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

It can therefore be described as a \"process optimization process.\" It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization. As a policy-making approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other total quality management or continual improvement process methodologies and BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology. As such, many BPM articles and scholars frequently discuss BPM from one of two viewpoints: people and/or technology. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers that may be located far from the user–ranging in distance from across a city to across the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over an electricity network. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

Alternatively, data is deemed of high quality if it correctly represents the real-world construct to which it refers. Furthermore, apart from these definitions, as data volume increases, the question of internal consistency within data becomes significant, regardless of fitness for use for any particular external purpose. People's views on data quality can often be in disagreement, even when discussing the same set of data used for the same purpose. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

It enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur at the source of the data. This approach requires leveraging resources that may not be continuously connected to a network such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and sensors. Edge Computing covers a wide range of technologies including wireless sensor networks, mobile data acquisition, mobile signature analysis, cooperative distributed peer-to-peer ad hoc networking and processing also classifiable as Local Cloud/Fog computing and Grid/Mesh Computing, dew computing, mobile edge computing, cloudlet, distributed data storage and retrieval, autonomic self-healing networks, remote cloud services, augmented reality, and more.

In particular the Apps Generic Enablers supports managing applications, services and data in a business framework across the whole service life cycle from creation through composition of applications and data to monetization and revenue sharing.

A couple of basic GEs are important to realize the vision of such an applications, services and data business framework, which enables new business models in an agile and flexible way. Among them: a store, a marketplace, a revenue sharing engine, an application composer through mashup and a data visualization and analysis component.

The Business Framework is heavily relying on USDL as common uniform description format for services which does not only focus on technical aspects of service, but also on business aspects as well as functional and non-functional service attributes.

The Application Mashup GE aims at allowing end users without programming skills to quickly compose beautiful web applications and dashboards/cockpits mashing up widgets, operators and data sources from a shared catalogue.

The Data Visualisation GE aims at creating agile, beautiful visualizations and meaningful reports useful to present the large variety of datasets. Data stakeholders will bring in the play as well as providing customisable data analytics."""@en ;

A device is a hardware entity, component or system that either measures properties of a thing/group of things or influences the properties of a thing/group of things or both measures/influences. Sensors and actuators are devices.

IoT Resources are computational elements (software) that provide the technical means to perform sensing and/or actuation on the device. The resource is usually hosted on the device.

IoT GEs have been spread in two different domains: Gateway and Backend. While IoT Gateway GEs provide inter-networking and protocol conversion functionalities between devices and the IoT Backend GEs, the IoT Backend GEs provide management functionalities for the devices and IoT domain-specific support for the applications."""@en ;

Creating secured and trusted services without sacrificing much of the desired functionality, usability, performance and cost efficiency is a great challenge, especially in a dynamic environment where new threats and attack methods emerge on a daily basis.

The overall ambition of the Security Architecture of FIWARE is to demonstrate that the Vision of an Internet that is \"secure by design\" is becoming reality. Based on achievements to date and/or to come in the short-term (both from a technological but also a standardization perspective) we will show that \"secure by design\" is possible.

Security, Privacy and Trust in FIWARE is mainly focusing on delivering tools and techniques to have the above-mentioned security needs properly met. Furthermore a decision making support and the automation of countermeasures allow alleviating the workload of users and administrators while raising their security awareness.

The high-level Reference Architecture is formed by four main blocks of GEs: Cybersecurity, Identity and Access Management (and Enforcement), Privacy, Trust and Trustworthiness."""@en ;

This approach is particularly suited to IoT systems and accelerates the decision-making velocity. This architecture serves a specific subset of business problems that can’t be successfully implemented using “cloud only” based architectures or relying solely on intelligent edge devices. OpenFog should be thought of as complementary to, and an extension of the traditional cloud based model where implementations of the architecture can reside in multiple layers of a network’s topology. The goal of the OpenFog architecture is to facilitate deployments which highlight interoperability, performance, security, scalability, programmability, reliability, availability, serviceability, and agility. Proprietary or single vendor solutions can result in limited supplier diversity, which can have a negative impact on market adoption, system cost, quality and innovation."@en ;

To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as error rates, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc. In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality.

Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, \"deployment\" should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair or mean time to recovery (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.
