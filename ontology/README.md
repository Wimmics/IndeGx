# The IndeGx ontology

Namespace: `http://ns.inria.fr/kg/index#`

Prefix: `kgi:`

The IndeGx ontology has 3 major goals:
- To support the structure of an index of semantic web resources, mainly SPARQL endpoints and RDF datasets.
- To support the declaration of the rules used by the IndeGx framework to generate said index.
- To declare elements that can add to the index using inference by an OWL RL reasoner.
