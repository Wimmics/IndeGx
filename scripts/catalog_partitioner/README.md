# Script to create catalog partitions from a DCAT catalog of endpoints

This script creates a set of catalog partitions from a DCAT catalog of endpoints. The catalog partitions are created based on the `dcat:sparqlEbndpoint` property of the catalog.

Uses [Corese-command](https://flathub.org/fr/apps/fr.inria.corese.CoreseCommand) to run SPARQL queries on the catalog.
