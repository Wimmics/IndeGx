# Script to try to remotely refresh the endpoint catalog from remote catalogs

TODO: This script is not yet complete. Awaiting a bug fix of the `corese-command convert` command.

NOTICE: This script will be broken by very unusual endpoint URLs, such as <https://allegro.callisto.calmip.univ-toulouse.fr/#/repositories/sms>, with a `#` in the middle of the URL.
